            Our works with organizations and government agencies to provide solutions to some of the greatest threats to people and our planet extreme poverty, depletion of natural resources, and natural disasters. These challenges are interwoven, and we know healthy communities and healthy ecosystems are mutually dependent. Through partnerships like these, we create programs that empower communities and individuals to manage their own resources, gain access to economic opportunities, reduce their vulnerability to climate change and other threats, and promote sustainable development.
            We are commited to partnerships at national, regional and global levels to ensure that people and nature thrive. Together, we leverage our best assets and pursue solutions to the worlds greatest development and conservation challenges.

       <td><h3> AMAZON RAINFOREST SOCIETY ALLIANCE </h3>
        The Amazon Rainforest Society Alliance focuses on sustainable solutions that lift women and men out of extreme poverty, with programs devoted to economic opportunity, gender equity, sustainable livelihoods, and natural resource conservation. Projects include helping communities in Mozambique sustainably manage fisheries, improving financial literacy and access to credit for women in Tanzania, and educating women in Nepal to manage forests in the face of climate change.

        <td><h3>USAID</h3>
        Together, USAID and the Amazon Rainforest Society work on biodiversity conservation projects with local communities around the world. This local to global focus is the cornerstone of their approach to international development. Through conservation, we also foster sustainable livelihoods and economic opportunities, which lead to decreased malnutrition and disease, and improved gender equity. For example, protecting snow leopards helped communities in Asias high mountains, and targeting corruption in the wildlife, forest, and fisheries trades, benefits those living under threat from such crimes.

              <h3>Environment and Disaster Management and Green Recovery</h3>
            Natural disasters are becoming more frequent and damaging. We know climate change and environmental degradation will place the most vulnerable communities in even greater risk. Healthy, resilient, and well-managed ecosystems must be part of disaster risk reduction activities not only to avoid unintended damage to neighboring communities, but also because environmental solutions often are often less costly, more effective, and more socially sustainable than traditional measures.
            <br><br>
            Following a disaster, there are two urgent priorities: the immediate needs of survivors and the restoration of devastated communities and environments. We work directly with humanitarian organizations, governments and local communities to help institute better practices for disaster response that ensures recovery includes environmental sustainability and climate variability, and also identifies ways environmental management can reduce disaster risks.
            <br><br>
            Our Environment & Disaster Management Program aims to address these issues. It grew out of the innovative Humanitarian Partnerships Program formed between Amazon Rainforest Society and the American Red Cross in the wake of the 2005 tsunami, which also resulted in the Green Recovery and Restoration Toolkit to guide environmentally responsible building after a disaster. We brought this program and its tools to bear in a variety of events, including the 2006 oil spill in the Philippines, the 2008 cyclones in Bangladesh and Mozambique, the 2008 Sichuan Province earthquake in China, and the 2010 earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, and the 2011 floods in Pakistan and Thailand.
